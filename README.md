Pingback 2 Webhook
==================

This is pingback2webhook.

This service, installable on your local server, allows you to add pingback and webmention support to any static page, and as well as collecting the data
you are able to specify a webhook(s) to which a ping is sent, allowing you to chain services together, and also to query the database.

This is very similar/inspired by Aaron Parecki's service Pingback.me (which I recommend you check out - <https://github.com/aaronpk/Pingback>), but this is 1) written in PHP (I had reasons I couldn't run ruby on the server), 2) Supports a few extra things that I needed.
